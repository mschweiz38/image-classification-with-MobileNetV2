# Image Classification: Deer vs Badger ðŸ¦ŒðŸ¦¡

This project demonstrates a binary image classification model to differentiate between images of deer and badgers. The model was built using TensorFlow and Keras, with MobileNetV2 as the backbone architecture.

# Project Overview
I created this project out of a personal interest in wildlife and artificial intelligence. Over the years, Iâ€™ve set up camera traps to observe and photograph wildlife in their natural habitats. This has fueled my curiosity about using AI to analyze these images, identifying species automatically and potentially gaining insights from the captured data.

After testing custom-built models, I decided to use a pre-trained model for this project to leverage the strength of transfer learning, particularly given the limited size of my dataset. With MobileNetV2, a lightweight architecture optimized for smaller datasets, the model adapts pre-existing features learned from the ImageNet dataset to help distinguish between two classes: Roe deer and Badger.

This project allowed me to explore transfer learning for a personal wildlife camera trap dataset, merging my passion for nature with my interest in machine learning. The use of MobileNetV2 with transfer learning helped overcome the constraints of a small dataset while achieving promising results.
